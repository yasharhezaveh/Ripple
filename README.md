# Ripple

This binary code can perform source reconstruction for strong lensing systems using interferometric data. If you use this code, please cite Hezaveh et al. 2016 (ApJ 823-37). This binary is not supported in any way. "Elemental" linear algenbra library, MPI, and GSL are needed to run the binary.
